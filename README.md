# OfficeVisitorLog-Python-Flask
Many companies work with different parties and it is important for them to log information about people visiting 
for wide variety of reasons. This project will help track and log information of everyone entering into the office. 
Data validation is done across all fields that the user enters for eg - name, email address, 
phone number and the person they are visiting. Data can be saved to an excel file.
